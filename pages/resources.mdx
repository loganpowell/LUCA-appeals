**The Census Bureau is not accepting or processing late LUCA submissions received after November 16, 2018. The Census Bureau is processing files and preparing for LUCA Feedback beginning in August 2019.**

LUCA is the only opportunity offered to tribal, state, and local governments to review and comment on the U.S. Census Bureau's residential address list for their jurisdiction prior to the 2020 Census. The Census Bureau relies on a complete and accurate address list to reach every living quarters and associated population for inclusion in the census. The [Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-430)](/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/luca/act-1994.html) authorizes the LUCA.

### Who Can Participate?

Active, functioning governments are eligible to participate in LUCA for areas including:

*   Federally recognized tribes with a reservation or off-reservation trust lands;
*   States;
*   Counties;
*   Cities (incorporated place); and
*   Townships (minor civil divisions).

If your government lacks the resources to participate in LUCA, you can arrange for a higher level of government, such as county, or an organization, such as regional planning agency or council of governments, to conduct your review.

### Why Participate?

*   Governments that participate in LUCA help ensure an accurate decennial census count for their communities.
*   An accurate count helps the federal government annually allocate more than $675 billion across 26 federal agencies for tribal, state, and local government programs and services.
*   To help your community plan for future needs.

### What is the LUCA Schedule?

*   January 2017:  Advance notification of LUCA mailed to the Tribal Chairpersons (TCs) and highest elected officials (HEOs) of all eligible governments and other LUCA contacts.

*   July 2017:  Invitation letter and registration forms mailed to the TC or HEO of all eligible governments.

### What are LUCA Review Materials?

### How Can I Review The Address Count List for My Entity?

The LUCA Address Count List files are available for download from our secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) site. The 2017 version of this product contained seven fields of information and was a pipe delimited text file. The 2018 version, updated in January 2018, is comma delimited and contains 13 fields of information. This updated file is the actual Address Count List material that accompanies participants’ official LUCA materials and it supports the GUPS software for those using the files to participate in LUCA. Please select American Indian Areas, a state, the District of Columbia (DC) or Puerto Rico (PR) from the menu below. For the states, DC and PR, after you select your state, click on the folder of your entity type (county, place, or mcd for Minor Civil Divisions) or use the Address Count List Locator file to determine the folder where your entity's Address Count List file is stored. More information about [opening and saving as a Microsoft Excel file](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/partnerships/luca/CommaDelimited_to_Excel.pdf). \[PDF\]

#### Geocoding Your Address List

To help your government prepare for LUCA, we suggest governments obtain Census geocodes for their addresses. This will allow governments to compare their address counts by block to the Census Bureau’s address counts by block, which are available using the drop-down menu above. To geocode your address list, governments with fewer than 10,000 addresses can use the [Census Geocoder](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/complete-technical-documentation/census-geocoder.html), and governments with over 10,000 addresses can use the LUCA Geocoding Service. To use the LUCA Geocoding Service, follow the [Instructions for the LUCA Geocoding Service](//www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/partnerships/luca/LUCA_geocoding_service.pdf) \[PDF\].

After geocoding your address file, you can import your geocoded addresses into GUPS. To do this, please follow the instructions for [Importing Geocoded Address Files into GUPS](//www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/partnerships/luca/Geocoder_Field_Parsing.pdf) \[PDF\].

### What If I Have Questions?

If you have questions regarding LUCA, call us at 1-844-344-0169 or email us at [geo.2020.luca@census.gov](mailto:geo.2020.luca@census.gov). Our LUCA Help Desk staff is available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. You may leave a message after hours and we will return your call within two business days. The Help Desk staff can assist you with any questions you may have concerning LUCA.
