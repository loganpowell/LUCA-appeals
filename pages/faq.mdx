### What is the Appeals process?
The LUCA Appeals Office, managed by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as
mandated by Public Law 103-430, works independently from the Census Bureau to resolve disagreements that may remain after governments receive the Census Bureau’s 2020 LUCA feedback. The procedures for filing an appeal become available during the summer of 2019.

### How long does our government have to file an appeal?
Your government has 45 days from receipt of 2020 LUCA Feedback materials to file an appeal.

### What is the result of the Appeals Office accepting or rejecting addresses in our appeal?
The Appeals Office reviews each address in your government’s appeal and makes a determination of
either acceptance or rejection. Your government receives notification of the Appeals Office findings. The Census Bureau will include accepted addresses in the 2020 Census enumeration universe and will not include those rejected by the Appeals Office.
