### About Title 13
Chapter 1, Section 9 of Title 13, U.S. Code states: “Neither the Secretary, nor any other officer or
employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof, or local government census
liaison, may, except as provided in section 8 or 16 or chapter 10 of this title:
1) Use the information furnished under the provisions of this title for any purpose other than the
statistical purposes for which it is supplied; or
2) Make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual
under this title can be identified; or
3) Permit anyone other than the sworn officers and employees of the Department or bureau or
agency thereof to examine the individual reports.”

In 1994, under Public Law 103-430, the U.S. Congress amended Chapter 1 of Title 13 to allow the local
government census liaison to review and update the Census Bureau’s address information for their
jurisdiction. Although the amendment allows official local government access, the amendment
reaffirmed the confidential nature of the Census Bureau’s address information. 

Census information protected under Title 13 includes:
- Everything on a completed or partially completed questionnaire or any information obtained in
a personal or telephone interview.
- Individual addresses maintained by the Census Bureau, including those shared with
governments through the 2020 Census Local Update of Census Addresses Operation (LUCA).
- Digital or paper maps with latitude/longitude coordinate data that identify the location of living
quarters (structure points).
- The penalty for the wrongful disclosure or release of information protected by Title 13 is a fine
of not more than $250,000 or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, as set by
Section 214 of the Code and the Uniform Sentencing Act of 1984.

Title 13 U.S.C. does not apply to generalized address information, such as address range data available in the Census Bureau’s digital products or address counts by census block.
