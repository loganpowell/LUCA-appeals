The Census Bureau provides LUCA Feedback Phase materials to eligible governments beginning in July
2019 and ending in September 2019. 

To ensure that tribal, state, and local governments participating in 2020 Census LUCA have a means to
Appeal the Census Bureau’s determinations, the Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994 requires
that the Administrator of OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), acting through the
Chief Statistician and in consultation with the Census Bureau, develop an Appeals Process by
establishing a temporary federal entity, the 2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office. This office will resolve
any disagreements that may remain after participating governments receive the Census Bureau’s LUCA
Feedback materials and make a final decision on the inclusion of appealed addresses. Participants must
contact staff in the 2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office, not the Census Bureau, for specific Appeal-related questions. 

### Mark Your Calendar:  The Deadline for Filing an Appeal

**The deadline for filing an Appeal is 45 calendar days after the date the participant receives their
feedback materials from the Census Bureau.** The 2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office defines “receipt” as the delivery date reported to the Census Bureau by the delivery service carrier. Upon receipt of an Appeal, the Appeals Staff will send a confirmation of receipt to the participant. They will notify the Census Bureau that a participant has filed an Appeal.

### Procedures for Filing an Appeal

A participant is eligible to file an Appeal if they returned address additions or corrections to the Census
Address List during the LUCA Review Phase, or if they certified, after review, that the Census Address
List was correct and required no updates. A participant may Appeal the following types of addresses:
- Address deletions from the Census Address List by another level of government participating in
LUCA or by a different census operation that participants did not comment on during the LUCA
Review Phase. The Detailed Feedback Address List identifies these addresses with the X01
feedback processing code in column 5 (Feedback Code). The 2020 Census enumeration universe
excludes these records.
- Address additions and corrections provided during the LUCA Review Phase that the Census
Bureau processed, but denied and excluded in the 2020 Census enumeration universe. The
Detailed Feedback Address List identifies these addresses with the R03 feedback processing
code in column 5 (Feedback Code).

### Supporting Documentation

The 2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office requires eligible participants to provide evidence of existence and the location for appealed addresses. To this end, eligible participants must provide the supporting
documentation for all appealed addresses.

### Preparing and Submitting Appeal Materials to the 2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office

To file an Appeal, participants must submit a hard copy of their written narrative and of their pages of
the Detailed Feedback Address List with records flagged for Appeal as described in Section 3.5.1.
They may choose to include hard copies of their source description(s) and supporting documentation or they may choose to include a CD or DVD with digital copies of their supporting documentation and
source description(s) to accompany their hard copy Detailed Feedback Address List pages and written
narrative.

After completing the review of the LUCA Feedback Phase materials and flagging some records for
Appeal, return only the pages of the Detailed Feedback Address List that contain records with a “Y” in
the Appeal Flag column. Please do not return unedited pages to the 2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office;
doing so complicates their review. Make, and retain, a copy of the edited pages for reference while the
Appeals Staff conducts their work.

### Shipping Instructions for Submitting Appeal Materials

Participants ship their hard copy materials and their CD or DVD of their digital information, if applicable, using the following instructions to package and ship materials to the 2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office:
- Double wrap the Appeals material (hard copy materials and/or the CD/DVD) using an inner and
an outer envelope (or container), one within the other. These should be durable enough to
prevent someone from viewing or tampering with the enclosed material.
- Label both sides of the inner envelope (or container) with the notice:
- “DISCLOSURE PROHIBITED BY TITLE 13, U.S.C.”
- Place the inner envelope (or container) into the outer envelope.
- Do not label the outer envelope with the disclosure notice.
- Ship using a service that provides tracking information, such as United States Postal Service
(USPS) trackable delivery, FedEx, United Parcel Service (UPS), or similar service. Retain the
tracking number as proof of delivery.

Ship to the following address for the 2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office:

**2020 Census LUCA Appeals Office
