# Body Content
The 2020 Census Local Update of Census Addresses Operation (LUCA) is a voluntary decennial census
operation. LUCA is the only opportunity prior to the 2020 Census for tribal, state, and local governments
(including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) to review and update the Census Bureau’s
residential address list for their jurisdiction. The Census Bureau relies on a complete and accurate
address list to reach every living quarters and associated population for inclusion in the census. 

The [Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-430)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/luca/act-1994.html) authorizes the LUCA operation.

In accordance with the law, the LUCA Feedback Phase provides participating governments with detailed
feedback materials that document which local address updates the Census Bureau processed. LUCA
participants may dispute the processing results of certain addresses, only if those addresses meet
certain eligibility criteria. 

Participants must file their Appeal within 45 calendar days after the receipt of the feedback materials. Appeals filed after the deadline will be denied. Filing an Appeal is optional and is
not a requirement of LUCA.
